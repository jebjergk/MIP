# 6. Trust & Eligibility

Being CONFIDENT (good data quality) is necessary but not sufficient. To actually trade, a pattern must also be **TRUSTED** — meaning its track record passes three performance gates:

## The Three Trust Gates

1. **Sample Size ≥ 40 signals** — Enough evaluated signals to be statistically meaningful. Below 40, the numbers could be luck — like flipping a coin 5 times and getting all heads.

2. **Hit Rate ≥ 55%** — More than half of evaluated outcomes must be "hits" — the price moved favorably beyond the minimum threshold. 55% means a meaningful edge over random chance (50%).

3. **Avg Return ≥ 0.05%** — The average realized return across all outcomes must be positive and above 0.0005 (0.05%). This ensures actual profitability, not just accuracy.

## Trust Labels

- **TRUSTED** — All three gates passed. The pattern CAN generate trade proposals. This is the definitive answer — once trusted, signals from this pattern are eligible for trading.

- **WATCH** — Close but not there yet. One or two gates are nearly met. The system is monitoring progress. No trading allowed — but it could flip to TRUSTED with a few more good outcomes.

- **UNTRUSTED** — Fails trust criteria significantly. Not enough evidence or poor performance. No trading. The pattern needs more time or may simply not be reliable for this symbol.

> **CONFIDENT ≠ TRUSTED.** A symbol can be CONFIDENT (score 85, lots of data) but NOT TRUSTED (e.g., hit rate is 50%, below the 55% threshold — plenty of data but poor accuracy). Conversely, a symbol can be TRUSTED before reaching CONFIDENT if its returns are strong on existing data. **The trust label is the definitive gate for trading.**
