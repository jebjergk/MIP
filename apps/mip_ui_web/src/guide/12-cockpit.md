# 12. Cockpit (Daily Dashboard)

Your daily command center. The Cockpit uses a **two-column news layout** to display everything you need in one view: portfolio performance, market conditions, AI-generated narratives, signal candidates, and training progress.

This is the page you should check first every morning.

## Layout Overview

The Cockpit is divided into two columns:

- **Left Column — Portfolios:** One expandable StoryCard per portfolio, showing performance, risk status, and lazy-loaded AI digest details.
- **Right Column — Market & System:** Market Pulse, System Overview (global digest), Signal Candidates, and Training Progress.

Each card uses a **StoryCard** design — a collapsible card with:
- A colored **attention dot** on the left border indicating urgency
- A **headline** (one-line summary)
- A **summary** (brief description visible when collapsed)
- **Badges** showing key status indicators
- **Expandable detail** — click to reveal the full content

### Attention Dot Colors

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Red (critical) | Something is broken or stopped — gate STOPPED, health BROKEN |
| Orange (warning) | Something needs watching — gate CAUTION, health STALE |
| Green (positive) | Good news — positive returns, healthy state |
| Blue (info) | Informational — signals available, near-miss symbols |
| Gray (neutral) | No notable activity |

---

## Left Column: Portfolios

Each portfolio appears as its own expandable StoryCard. Active portfolios appear first, followed by inactive/ended portfolios under a separate "Inactive / Ended" label.

### Portfolio StoryCard (collapsed view)

- **Headline:** Portfolio name with total return percentage. Example: "Main FX Portfolio — +2.4%"
- **Summary:** Key stats at a glance. Example: "Equity: $102,450 · Gate: SAFE · Max DD: -4.2%"
- **Gate Badge:** Color-coded risk gate status (SAFE green, CAUTION yellow, STOPPED red)
- **Health Badge:** Data freshness indicator (OK green, STALE yellow, BROKEN red)

### Portfolio StoryCard (expanded view)

When you click to expand a portfolio card, you see:

- **KPI Strip:** Four metric boxes showing Equity, Return, Max Drawdown, and Paid Out (if any)
- **Gate Explanation:** If the risk gate is not SAFE, a text explanation appears. Example: "Episode drawdown at 4.2% (threshold: 5.0%). Approaching risk limit."
- **AI Digest:** Lazy-loaded from the API when you first expand the card. Includes:
  - **Headline** — AI-generated one-line summary of this portfolio's current state
  - **AI / Deterministic badge** — "Cortex AI" means LLM-generated narrative; "Deterministic" means template fallback
  - **Detector Pills** — Colored pills for interest detectors that fired (green = low severity, orange = medium, red = high)
  - **What Changed** — Bullets describing differences from yesterday
  - **What Matters** — Bullets explaining important observations and implications
  - **Waiting For** — Bullets describing upcoming triggers or thresholds
  - **Drill Links** — Links to related pages (Signals, Training, Portfolio detail)
- **Navigation Links:** "Full Portfolio →" and "Suggestions →" links at the bottom

## Right Column: Market & System

### Market Pulse Card

An overview of today's market conditions across all tracked symbols.

**Headline:** Shows how many symbols gained today. Example: "Market Pulse — 8 of 12 symbols gained today"

**Badges:**
- **Nasdaq badge** — indicates the data source
- **Direction badge** — UP (green), DOWN (red), or MIXED (gray)

**Expanded content:**
- **KPI Strip:** Five metrics — Up count, Down count, Flat count, Avg Return, and Breadth (% of symbols that are up)
- **Top Movers:** The 3 biggest gainers and 3 biggest losers with their daily return percentages
- **Equal-Weight Universe Index Chart:** An area chart showing the equal-weight index return over the lookback period. A green line above zero means the universe is up overall; red means down.
- **Daily Returns by Symbol:** A horizontal bar chart showing every tracked symbol's daily return, sorted from highest to lowest. Green bars = positive return, red bars = negative.

### System Overview Card (Global Digest)

An AI-generated narrative covering the **entire system** — all portfolios, all symbols, all patterns.

**Badges:**
- **"Global"** scope badge
- **Cortex AI / Deterministic** — whether the narrative was generated by the LLM or a template fallback
- **Fresh / Stale** — "Fresh (45m ago)" means recent; "Stale (3h ago)" means older than 2 hours

**Expanded content:**
- **Detector Pills** — Colored pills showing which "interest detectors" fired today. These are deterministic rules like "Gate status changed" or "New trusted pattern." Colors: green = low severity (informational), orange = medium (noteworthy), red = high (urgent).
- **What Changed** — Bullets describing what's different from yesterday. Example: "AUD/USD moved from LEARNING to CONFIDENT stage."
- **What Matters** — Bullets explaining the most important observations and their implications. Example: "Only 2 of 12 momentum signals passed the z-score gate (observed < 1.0), suggesting the market is quiet — expect fewer proposals."
- **Waiting For** — Bullets describing upcoming triggers or thresholds. Example: "EUR/USD needs 5 more evaluated outcomes to reach CONFIDENT (35 of 40 threshold)."
- **Drill Links** — Contextual links to relevant pages based on the narrative content

### Signal Candidates Card

The top signal candidates today, ranked by maturity and outcome history.

**Headline:** Shows the count. Example: "3 Signal Candidates Today" or "Signal Candidates — None Today"

**Expanded content:**
- Up to 8 signal candidates, each showing:
  - **Rank (#1–#8)** — Position in the ranking
  - **Symbol** — The asset being tracked (e.g., AAPL, EUR/USD)
  - **Maturity Stage pill** — Color-coded badge showing INSUFFICIENT / WARMING_UP / LEARNING / CONFIDENT
  - **Score** — Maturity score out of 100
  - **Progress bar** — Visual bar from 0–100 showing the maturity score
  - **"Why" text** — A deterministic explanation of why this symbol appears here. Example: "Meets minimum recs ≥ 10, horizon coverage 100%, strong 5-bar return."

### Training Progress Card

An AI narrative focused on the training pipeline across all symbols.

**Headline:** AI-generated summary of training state. Example: "2 symbols approaching CONFIDENT stage"

**Expanded content:**
- **What Changed** — Training-related changes (stage promotions, new outcomes)
- **What Matters** — Key observations for upcoming trust decisions
- **Waiting For** — What the system needs before more symbols can advance
- **Upcoming Symbols Detail:**
  - **Near-Miss Symbols** — Up to 6 symbols almost at the next stage threshold. Each shows symbol name, market type, current stage, score, progress bar, and gap to next stage. Example: "Score: 72/100, Gap to CONFIDENT: 3 pts"
  - **Trade-Ready (CONFIDENT)** — Up to 4 symbols already at CONFIDENT stage. These are the strongest candidates that may already be generating proposals if trusted.
