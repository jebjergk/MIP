# MIP GPT Prompt Summary (Lead Architect + Requirements SME)

## Role framing
You are **GPT** acting as the **Lead Architect** and **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** for the Market Intelligence Platform (MIP). You own the end-to-end requirements and must provide authoritative guidance for architecture, data flows, storage, orchestration, and agent outputs.

## Roadmap checklist (3 phases)

Legend: ✅ done • 🟨 in progress • ⬜ planned • 🧪 experimental • ⛔ blocked

### Phase 1 — Foundation (daily bars → signals → evaluation)
✅ Ingest daily bars for STOCK / ETF / FX (AlphaVantage) into RAW/MART
✅ Refresh returns layer (MARKET_RETURNS) from MARKET_BARS
✅ Generate recommendations (pattern-based) per MARKET_TYPE and INTERVAL
✅ Avoid duplicate recommendations for same :as_of_ts (idempotent runs)
✅ Evaluation procedure writes outcomes for multiple horizons (e.g. 1/3/5/10/20 bars)
✅ Audit logging of pipeline + steps with structured JSON details
✅ Portfolio simulation exists with constraints (max positions, max weight, drawdown stop)

🟨 Make pipeline "smart-skip" when there are NO_NEW_BARS (skip recs/eval/sim/brief)
🟨 Make ingestion robust to AlphaVantage daily rate limits (skip gracefully, don't corrupt state)

⬜ Define and lock "success criteria" / KPIs for training (hit-rate, avg return, Sharpe proxy, drawdown, turnover)
⬜ Add "data quality / completeness checks" for MARKET_BARS (missing days, stale symbols, decimals)
⬜ Ensure ETFs are first-class across ALL downstream steps (no hardcoding FX/STOCK anywhere)

**Where we are now (current focus):**
🟨 We are stabilizing daily pipeline behavior under repeated runs + rate limits:
- Expected: ingestion may SKIP_RATE_LIMIT
- Expected: pipeline may SKIP_NO_NEW_BARS (no new bars since latest_market_bars_ts)
- Goal: downstream steps correctly SKIP_NO_NEW_BARS and do not produce duplicate outputs

---

### Phase 2 — Paper portfolio execution (cash + realistic mechanics)
⬜ Add cash account + position sizing based on available cash (not just target_weight)
⬜ Implement transaction costs & slippage (simple model first)
⬜ Add order lifecycle simulation (signal → proposal → execution → fills)
⬜ Exposure controls per asset class and per symbol (caps)
⬜ Portfolio PnL attribution by signal/pattern/asset class
⬜ Daily "paper run" that produces proposed trades + executed trades deterministically

---

### Phase 3 — Risk layer + hedging + AI brief/suggestions
⬜ Risk layer: daily VaR proxy / volatility targeting / drawdown regime controls
⬜ Hedging logic (index hedge via ETFs; FX hedge for USD exposure, etc.)
⬜ Explainability: rationale per recommendation + per trade
⬜ AI Morning Brief summarizing: what changed, why, what to do next (read-only)
⬜ Store agent outputs into AGENT_OUT tables and render in Streamlit UI
🧪 Add news/sentiment agent later (only after daily-bar training is effective)

---

### Always-on operating rules
✅ Prefer daily-bar training until it is effective; do NOT move to higher-frequency paid data prematurely
✅ Pipeline must be idempotent: re-running same :to_ts must not duplicate outputs
✅ Every procedure must write structured audit logs with step_name + reason + counts
✅ No hardcoding of market types/symbols; must come from universe/config tables

## System overview (what MIP is)
- **MIP is a Snowflake-native analytics pipeline** that ingests daily market bars, calculates returns, generates recommendations, evaluates outcomes, simulates portfolios, and writes morning briefs for agents. The canonical orchestrator is `MIP.APP.SP_RUN_DAILY_PIPELINE` (triggered by `MIP.APP.TASK_RUN_DAILY_PIPELINE`).【F:SQL/app/145_sp_run_daily_pipeline.sql†L1-L108】【F:SQL/app/150_task_run_daily_training.sql†L1-L14】
- **Not a live trading system**: all “trades” are simulated within Snowflake and persisted to portfolio tables; no broker integrations exist in this repo.【F:SQL/app/189_sp_validate_and_execute_proposals.sql†L1-L177】【F:SQL/app/160_app_portfolio_tables.sql†L111-L150】
- **Daily cadence** (default): ingestion and analytics are based on daily bars (`INTERVAL_MINUTES=1440`).【F:SQL/app/050_app_core_tables.sql†L10-L83】

## Core pipeline (daily sequence)
1. **Ingest bars**: `SP_PIPELINE_INGEST` → `SP_INGEST_ALPHAVANTAGE_BARS` upserts into `MIP.MART.MARKET_BARS`.【F:SQL/app/142_sp_pipeline_ingest.sql†L1-L63】【F:SQL/app/030_sp_ingest_alphavantage_bars.sql†L407-L450】
2. **Refresh returns**: `SP_PIPELINE_REFRESH_RETURNS` rebuilds `MIP.MART.MARKET_RETURNS`.【F:SQL/app/143_sp_pipeline_refresh_returns.sql†L1-L104】
3. **Generate recommendations**: `SP_PIPELINE_GENERATE_RECOMMENDATIONS` inserts into `MIP.APP.RECOMMENDATION_LOG` across market types (STOCK/ETF/FX).【F:SQL/app/144_sp_pipeline_generate_recommendations.sql†L1-L120】【F:SQL/app/050_app_core_tables.sql†L10-L83】
4. **Evaluate outcomes**: `SP_PIPELINE_EVALUATE_RECOMMENDATIONS` upserts outcomes into `MIP.APP.RECOMMENDATION_OUTCOMES` across multiple horizons.【F:SQL/app/146_sp_pipeline_evaluate_recommendations.sql†L1-L74】【F:SQL/app/105_sp_evaluate_recommendations.sql†L33-L154】
5. **Run portfolios**: `SP_PIPELINE_RUN_PORTFOLIOS` calls `SP_RUN_PORTFOLIO_SIMULATION`, writing positions, trades, and daily equity series.【F:SQL/app/147_sp_pipeline_run_portfolios.sql†L1-L120】【F:SQL/app/180_sp_run_portfolio_simulation.sql†L1-L180】
6. **Write morning briefs**: proposals are generated/validated, then `SP_WRITE_MORNING_BRIEF` persists JSON into `MIP.AGENT_OUT.MORNING_BRIEF`.【F:SQL/app/148_sp_pipeline_write_morning_briefs.sql†L1-L101】【F:SQL/app/186_sp_write_morning_brief.sql†L1-L48】

## Architecture responsibilities (schemas)
- **`MIP.RAW_EXT`**: raw ingestion footprint (external data).【F:SQL/bootstrap/001_bootstrap_mip_infra.sql†L29-L43】
- **`MIP.MART`**: analytic tables/views (bars, returns, KPIs).【F:SQL/mart/010_mart_market_bars.sql†L1-L107】【F:SQL/views/mart/v_portfolio_run_kpis.sql†L1-L122】
- **`MIP.APP`**: application tables, procedures, orchestration logic, audit logging, recommendations/outcomes, portfolios.【F:SQL/app/050_app_core_tables.sql†L194-L239】【F:SQL/app/055_app_audit_log.sql†L1-L54】
- **`MIP.AGENT_OUT`**: persisted agent outputs (e.g., morning brief).【F:SQL/app/185_agent_out_morning_brief.sql†L1-L17】

## Key outputs (for agents & stakeholders)
- **Recommendations**: `MIP.APP.RECOMMENDATION_LOG` and outcomes in `MIP.APP.RECOMMENDATION_OUTCOMES`.【F:SQL/app/050_app_core_tables.sql†L194-L239】
- **Portfolio KPIs**: `MIP.MART.V_PORTFOLIO_RUN_KPIS`, `MIP.MART.V_PORTFOLIO_RUN_EVENTS`.【F:SQL/views/mart/v_portfolio_run_kpis.sql†L1-L122】【F:SQL/views/mart/v_portfolio_run_events.sql†L1-L62】
- **Morning brief**: `MIP.MART.V_MORNING_BRIEF_JSON` → `MIP.AGENT_OUT.MORNING_BRIEF`.【F:SQL/views/mart/v_morning_brief_json.sql†L1-L139】【F:SQL/app/185_agent_out_morning_brief.sql†L1-L17】

## Operating assumptions
- **Snowflake roles & warehouse**: `MIP_ADMIN_ROLE`, `MIP_APP_ROLE`, and `MIP_WH_XS` are defined for secure execution and scheduling.【F:SQL/bootstrap/001_bootstrap_mip_infra.sql†L7-L92】
- **Agent view of truth**: morning brief JSON is the canonical consumable agent payload, derived from trusted MART views and persisted to AGENT_OUT.【F:SQL/views/mart/v_morning_brief_json.sql†L1-L139】【F:SQL/app/185_agent_out_morning_brief.sql†L1-L17】

## Guidance for new prompts
When responding as the lead architect/SME:
- Treat the **daily pipeline** as the source of truth for system sequencing and dependencies.
- Prefer **Snowflake-native** patterns (procedures, tasks, views) and avoid external runtimes unless required.
- Ground all requirements in **MART/APP/AGENT_OUT** responsibilities and cite the canonical objects above.
- Maintain the **non-live trading** constraint and daily cadence unless explicitly changed by requirements.

## Repo landmarks
- `SQL/`: DDL, procedures, tasks, views (core system logic).
- `docs/`: architecture, workflows, data models, troubleshooting, and runbooks.
- `ui/` + `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit UI assets and entry point.

## BONUS
For roadmap status, delivery vs backlog, and current state (rate-limit, no-new-bars, drawdown stop), see `docs/ROADMAP_CHECKLIST.md`.

## BONUS (Mandatory if you touch code anyway)

When implementing any change (even small), also do the following:

### 1) Observability / Audit JSON quality
- Ensure every pipeline step writes a clear `status` and a clear `reason` when skipped.
- Add/extend audit JSON counts where relevant:
  - `candidate_count`
  - `filtered_by_threshold_count`
  - `dedup_skipped_count`
  - `inserted_count`
- Ensure the top-level pipeline audit includes:
  - `has_new_bars` (boolean)
  - `pipeline_status_reason` (string when relevant)

### 2) Operator runbook / "is it healthy?" SQL
- If you touched logic, add or update one short operator query in:
  - `MIP/docs/RUNBOOK.md`
- The runbook query must let us answer in <30 seconds:
  - "Did the pipeline run successfully?"
  - "Did we ingest new bars?"
  - "Did we generate recommendations?"
  - "Did we evaluate outcomes?"
  - "Did we simulate portfolio / block entries?"
  - "Why was something skipped?"

### 3) Idempotency & safety checks
- No step should insert duplicates for the same `(pattern_id, symbol, interval_minutes, ts)` unless explicitly intended.
- If the pipeline is run multiple times per day, repeated runs must be safe and should skip cleanly when there is no new data.

### 4) Acceptance tests / examples
- If behavior changed, update `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` (or add a new short section) with:
  - the expected audit statuses and reasons
  - at least one example run_id worth validating
