# Market Intelligence Platform

## Infra & Security Model

### Snowflake-Native Overview
The Market Intelligence Platform (MIP) runs entirely within Snowflake, leveraging Snowflake-native data, compute, and governance features to keep application logic and analytics close to the data.

### Core Database Structure
- **MIP.MART** – Houses analytic models such as curated views and table functions that power downstream insights.
- **MIP.APP** – Stores application configuration, shared stored procedures, and reusable pattern tables that drive the app runtime.
- **MIP.AGENT_OUT** – Reserved for future agentic AI outputs generated by the platform.

### Roles
- **MIP_ADMIN_ROLE** – Full administrative and development control over all MIP assets, including grants and deployment workflows.
- **MIP_APP_ROLE** – Restricted runtime role for the application, limited to the reads and executions it requires.

### Warehouse
- **MIP_WH_XS** – Extra-small warehouse optimized for cost-efficient development and runtime execution of the application workloads.
